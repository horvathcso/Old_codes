# Linear Programing
In the Gusek folder there are some example of build model/task which can be solved with the Gusek LP solver.
In the other folder there are some codes to solve Uni tasks. It is also LP modelling, but written in python using the pulp module. (alternative moduls would be in python the Gurobi or mip. Or we could use the CPLEX solver by IBM for the same tasks)
